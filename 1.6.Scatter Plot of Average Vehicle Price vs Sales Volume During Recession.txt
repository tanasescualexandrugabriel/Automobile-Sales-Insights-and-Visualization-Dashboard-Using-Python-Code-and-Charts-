This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the average price of vehicles and their sales volume during recession periods. By plotting these two variables, we can observe if there's any correlation between the vehicle price and sales volume in tough economic times.

Hereâ€™s the Python code i used to generate the plot:

# Sample data for average vehicle price and sales volume during recession
vehicle_prices = [15000, 20000, 25000, 30000, 35000, 40000, 45000]
sales_volume = [700, 650, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200]

# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(vehicle_prices, sales_volume, color='green')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Average Vehicle Price vs Sales Volume During Recession')
plt.xlabel('Average Vehicle Price ($)')
plt.ylabel('Sales Volume')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
