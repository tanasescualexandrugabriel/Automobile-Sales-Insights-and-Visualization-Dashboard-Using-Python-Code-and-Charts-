# Automobile-Sales-Insights-and-Visualization-Dashboard-Using-Python-Code-and-Charts-
This project explores automobile sales trends through data visualization and an interactive dashboard. Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Dash, it analyzes how recession periods, seasonal changes, and economic factors like GDP and unemployment rates impact sales, providing insights into market patterns and trends.


Project Tasks Overview:
You can open the .py files using Visual Studio Code to view the code. The code is also documented in corresponding .txt files. Additionally, images (charts) illustrating the data visualizations are included in the project.

Task 1: Data Visualization (Using Matplotlib)
Task 1.1: Line Plot of Automobile Sales Fluctuations Over the Years
Creates a line chart to observe fluctuations in automobile sales over multiple years, helping to identify overall trends of increase and decrease in sales.

Task 1.2: Sales Trends for Different Vehicle Types During Recession Periods
Develops a multi-line chart to show sales trends for various vehicle types specifically during recession periods, identifying potential differences in how each category was affected.

Task 1.3: Bar Chart Comparing Vehicle Sales Trends for Recession vs Non-Recession Periods
A bar chart comparison of vehicle sales between recession and non-recession periods to visualize how different economic conditions impact sales volumes.

Task 1.4: GDP Variations During Recession and Non-Recession Periods
Using subplots, line charts are created to show GDP variations during recession and non-recession periods, enabling a direct comparison of economic fluctuations.

Task 1.5: Bubble Plot of Seasonality’s Impact on Automobile Sales
This bubble plot visualizes how seasonality affects automobile sales, with each bubble representing a season and its size indicating sales volume.

Task 1.6: Scatter Plot: Average Vehicle Price vs. Sales Volume During Recession
A scatter plot is used to analyze the correlation between average vehicle price and sales volume during recession periods, providing insights into pricing impact on sales.

Task 1.7: Pie Chart: Advertising Expenditure in Recession vs Non-Recession
A pie chart to display the proportion of advertising expenditure by XYZAutomotives in recession versus non-recession periods, visualizing the allocation of marketing budgets in different economic climates.

Task 1.8: Pie Chart: Advertisement Expenditure by Vehicle Type During Recession
A pie chart displays total advertising expenditure for each vehicle type during a recession period, helping to visualize marketing distribution across vehicle categories.

Task 1.9: Line Plot: Unemployment Rate’s Effect on Vehicle Type and Sales in Recession
Creates a line chart analyzing how unemployment rates impact sales by vehicle type during recession periods, to assess whether certain vehicle types are more affected by unemployment changes.

Task 2.1: Creating a Dash Application with Title
Sets up a Dash application with a descriptive title to frame the purpose of the dashboard, focusing on vehicle sales and economic trends.

Task 2.2: Adding Dropdowns to the Dashboard
Adds dropdowns to the dashboard, enabling users to filter and select different time periods, vehicle types, or economic indicators.

Task 2.3: Creating an Output Division for Display
Defines an output division for dynamic data display, with id and classname properties to ensure the dashboard updates based on user input.

Task 2.4: Defining Callbacks for Dashboard Interactivity
Sets up callbacks in Dash to update the dashboard when users change selections in the dropdowns, allowing graphs and statistics to refresh in real-time.

Task 2.5: Graphs for Recession Report Statistics
Displays graphs for recession-related statistics, visualizing the impact of recession on sales, unemployment, and other indicators.
