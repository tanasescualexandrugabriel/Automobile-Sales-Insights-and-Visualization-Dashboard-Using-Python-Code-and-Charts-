In this task, i created a simple Dash application and set a meaningful title. The application will be used to analyze automobile sales data, economic indicators such as GDP and unemployment rate, and visualize trends during recession and non-recession periods.

Hereâ€™s the Python code i used to set up the Dash application:



# Initialize the Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Create the layout with a meaningful title
app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(children='Automobile Sales and Economic Impact Analysis Dashboard'),
    dcc.Graph(id='example-graph'),
])

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
